# ApacheSpark_ApacheZeppelin_SQL_Shell
Run your first analysis project on Apache Zeppelin using Scala (Spark), Shell, and SQL.

Apache Zeppelin can efficiently share analysis between employees of small or middle-size companies (or research centres at universities). 
The visualisation power of Apache Zeppelin makes it a suitable substitution for Microsoft Power BI if you are looking for a solution to share your analysis with your manager quickly and hassle-free.

I wrote an article here that shows how you can use Scala and SQL to provide an analysis for end users.
